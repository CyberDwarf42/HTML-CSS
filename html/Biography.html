		<p class="biography">Hi my name is Aaron, I am currently studying software development, and am setting this up as I learn HTML. I grew up on a dairy farm, and have some experience working with computers, not only from doing cyber school for a number of years, but also due to working in a shipping environment, and doing some retro pc gaming, which often requires a bit of work. I am also filling out a bunch of text, so that I can mess around with layout so it all fits nicely and hopefully I can mess around more with all of this, yes at this point it is basically filler text. I currently am employed at a hardware store, and I am doing online college for software development. I am hoping to be finished with that by the end of 2022. I really want to work in software testing, making sure things actually work before they hit the customers. I enjoy playing video games and board games in my spare time, and reading books as well, along with watching movies with people.</p>
